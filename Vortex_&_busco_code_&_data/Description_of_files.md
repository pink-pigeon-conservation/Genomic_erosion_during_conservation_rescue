**Final_vortex_simulations_Scenario_1_YearVsParams.rda** - R data needed (along with the VortexR code) to produce the vortex graph of population size against years (Figure 4B).

**longevity_data_for_LE.csv** - Data used in regression to calculate the number of lethal equivalents in the pink pigeon


## Code

**Busco_analysis.md** - Code for BUSCO analysis

**longevity_data_for_LE.R** - R code used to calculate the number of lethal equivalents in the pink pigeon using linear regression

**Figure 4C.ipynb** - iPython notebook containing code to run to produce the heatplot used in Figure 4C

**Kmer_spectra_plot.txt** - Command used to produce Kmer spectra

**VortexR_3_Main_scenarios.R** - Code used to run VortexR analaysis to examine statistical significance of Vortex results and also to produce the plot 4B.
